JONQUIERE, Quebec _ Both men left the confines of Quebec for federal politics years ago. Both served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Both later switched parties and both have come home to fight for the future of Canada's French-speaking province. 

 But whatever similarities once existed between them have faded. Lucien Bouchard, the premier of Quebec, and Jean Charest, the leader of the province's Liberal Party, are now locked in a do-or-die election that on Nov. 30 will decide, to a large extent, whether Quebec's long flirtation with secession will succeed at last. 

 Bouchard has promised that if his Parti Quebecois is re-elected he will hold a third referendum on separation, probably by 2001. The last referendum, in 1995, fell just 50,000 votes short of authorizing Quebec to negotiate its way out of Canada. 

 Charest says there will be no referendum if he is premier. Many political analysts say that could take away the separatists' last opportunity to win, because passion for independence is waning. The continuing exodus of English speakers is largely offset by the declining local birth rate, and the large influx of immigrants tends to vote against secession. 

 ``If Quebec hasn't solved this problem'' in the next few years, said Alain Dubuc, chief editorial writer for La Presse, a Montreal daily newspaper, ``completely different rules will apply.'' 

 Bouchard, 59, is a passionate separatist. He is a sometimes hotheaded francophone as independent as is Jonquiere, the rugged area on the fierce Saguenay River that Quebecers proudly consider their frontier. 

 It is a place of oversized dimensions _ of huge aluminum smelters, prodigious paper mills and uncontainable ambition for Quebec independence _ all reflected in the fiery character of Bouchard. He is determined to carry Quebec to what he sees as its destiny as an independent, French-speaking nation in North America. 

 Charest, 40, is a curly-haired federalist who is as comfortably bilingual as is Sherbrooke, his home in the Eastern Townships near the Vermont-New Hampshire border. 

 It is a place where English- and French-speaking families have long lived side by side, a place so accommodating that English street signs include French footnotes, like Rue Wellington, ``General Britannique, 1769-1852.'' 

 Charest was leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party before being drafted by supporters to take on Bouchard and vanquish the separatist threat. He has staked his promising political career on the crusade to keep Quebec in Canada. 

 If Quebec were to vote for secession, a complicated series of negotiations would follow to settle such questions as the province's share of the national debt and compensation for federal properties. There would also be a bitter fight over what to do with areas of the province that do not want to leave Canada, particularly northern lands that are home to Cree Indians who have voted overwhelmingly against separation. 

 So far opinion polls have the Liberals and the Parti Quebecois running just about even, with the separatists recently pulling slightly ahead. 

 Under Quebec's parliamentary system, Bouchard and Charest run in their local districts, but as party leader either automatically becomes premier if his party gains a majority. English-speaking Quebecers are bunched in Montreal and the Eastern Townships. 

 If current trends continue, the Liberals will not win the majority of legislative seats that they need to form the next government. 

 Jean-Marc Leger, president of Leger & Leger, a Montreal polling company, said a Charest victory would turn demographics against the separatists. But he expects Bouchard to win, and he said the margin of victory would affect the timetable for a referendum.

 ``If Bouchard gets 45, 46 percent of the vote, I'm not sure he would try a referendum,'' Leger said. ``But if he gets 48, 49 percent, he would hold one for sure. If he gets more than 50 percent, and it's possible, he will have a referendum within six months.'' 

 Charest concedes nothing. 

 ``This is a campaign, period,'' he said. ``We're in a battle, period. And in the best sense of the word, it's democracy at work, and we are going to win.'' 

 Bouchard, bolstered by the polls, has assumed an air of confidence. ``The only true solution for Quebec,'' he said, ``is Quebec sovereignty.''
