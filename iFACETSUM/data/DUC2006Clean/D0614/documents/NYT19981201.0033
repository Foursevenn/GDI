QUEBEC _ Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti Quebecois have retained control of Canada's largest province, possibly setting the stage for a bitter confrontation with the rest of Canada, and possibly another referendum on independence. 

 With nearly all 23,000 polling stations reporting late Monday night, the separatist party had 42.8 percent of the vote, compared with 43.6 percent for the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party and 12 percent for a third party, Democratic Action. The separatists were expected to win 77 of the provincial assembly's 125 seats, the Liberals 46 and Democratic Action 1, with one seat unfilled because of a death during the campaign. 

 Bouchard appeared to have had more difficulty than expected defeating the provincial Liberal Party leader, Jean Charest, on whom many people in English Canada had pinned their hopes for an end to the French-speaking province's 30 years of threats to separate. 

 With results still trickling in, the separatists were projected to take roughly the same number of districts in the provincial assembly as in 1994, with roughly the same percentage of the overall vote as in the last election. Bouchard had been counting on a gain of several seats to solidify his support. 

 The separatists fell short of the 46 percent they had said they needed to succeed in a third referendum to take Quebec out of Canada and form an independent nation of roughly seven million people on the northern border of the United States. 

 The separatists have lost two previous referendums, one decisively in 1980, the other narrowly in 1995. 

 Bouchard's support is strongest among French-speaking voters, who are more evenly spread throughout the province than English speakers, who are concentrated in and around the city of Montreal and who traditionally vote for the Liberals and against separation. It was the third-party candidate, Mario Dumont, who seemed to have drawn votes from the separatists. 

 Bouchard told voters during the campaign that he would hold another referendum in the four to five years of his government if ``winning conditions'' existed. While he never defined those conditions, it was widely believed that one of them was a level of popular support above 46 percent. 

 Voters sided with Bouchard even though the support for separation has declined. Recent polls indicate that only 43 percent of Quebecers would vote yes in another referendum on independence, a drop of four percentage points during the course of the campaign. 

 ``For the past few weeks, I have had the feeling that were it not for the issue of sovereignty, a greater number of English speaking Quebeckers would have supported our program,'' Bouchard said in a restrained victory speech before supporters here in Quebec. 

 He mentioned sovereighnty only once, repeating his pledge to create the ``winning conditions'' under which a referendum could be won. But he also acknowledged that the lower than expected level of support for his party reflected a disastisfaction among voters that he could not ignore. 

 ``I respect the signal you sent by choosing candidates who reflect their attachnment to Canada,'' he said. ``We have decided to stay the course no matter what political decisions the people of Quebec make for themselves.'' 

 What appeared to be taking place, analysts said, is that Quebecers see this election as a vote on government, not on independence, so separatist emotions are in check. But voters want Bouchard to keep alive the possibility of another referendum on separation as a way of increasing the province's leverage with Ottawa in upcoming discussions about changes in the shape of Canadian federalism. 

 Even without a referendum, Bouchard's re-election would increase tensions and uncertainty in Canada. During the campaign, he said he would demand substantial changes in the Canadian federation, forcing Ottawa to give back more powers over social programs not just to Quebec but to all 10 provinces. 

 In one stroke, he silenced the critics in his own party who suspected his commitment to changing relations with the central government, and he undercut the position of Charest, who equated a vote for the Parti Quebecois with a vote for separation. 

 ``We don't want, and Quebecers don't want, to be divided during the next four years,'' Charest said in a concession speech in his home district of Sherbrooke, where he narrowly regained his seat in the provincial assembly. He said he would not resign, but would fight as leader of the opposition to bring Quebec together. 

 ``The people of Quebec, like the people of all of Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success whatever government it has,'' Charest said. 

 When Charest announced last spring that he would challenge Bouchard in the election, analysts gave the Parti Quebecois little chance of retaining power. Many in English Canada believed that if Charest, a popular federal politician, could win and impose a moratorium on referendums for the next four to five years, he could end or severely impede the separatist movement, whose strength has been diluted by immigration and demographic change. 

 But Charest's campaign never caught on. It is expected that there will now be calls for his resignation, and that of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who is against changes to the Canadian federation.
