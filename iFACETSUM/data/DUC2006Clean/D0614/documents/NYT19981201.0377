MONTREAL _ While the results of Quebec's provincial election are muddy enough for both major parties to claim a victory of sorts, and to bear some degree of defeat, the real losers are those who had hoped the election would provide a clear sense of where Quebec, and Canada, are heading. 

 Although the separatists were returned to power, they could not even muster a plurality of the popular vote. The election results keep the independence movement alive, but it is wounded. 

 That means Premier Lucien Bouchard will not call another wrenching referendum on breaking away from Canada any time soon, though he has not ruled out doing so later. 

 ``Quebecers have said that the time is not propitious for a referendum, at least not immediately,'' Bouchard said Tuesday at a news conference in Quebec. 

 He is clearly disappointed that he had not increased the number of seats his party holds in the provincial assembly. Nor was he able to maintain the percentage of the overall vote his party had in the last elections in 1994. 

 In the final results of Monday's election, his separatist Parti Quebecois won 75 seats, two fewer than in 1994, while the Liberal Party, which favors keeping Quebec in Canada, won 48, an increase of one. A small third party won one seat, and a special election will be held in a few weeks for one district where the incumbent died recently. That district is expected to go to the separatists. 

 In the popular vote, which is seen as an indication of probable strength for sovereignty, the separatists got 42.7 percent, while the Liberals won 43.7 percent. A clear majority would be needed for a referendum to pass. 

 But Bouchard refused to rule out completely the possibility of holding another vote on separation. Instead, he reiterated the position he took during the campaign: that he would call a referendum _ which he has the right to do at any time during his term _ when he could be sure it was winnable. 

 During the campaign Bouchard did not spell out the conditions under which he would consider the vote winnable, and he skirted the issue again Tuesday. But he has made it clear that several problems must be tackled before conditions are ripe for another referendum. 

 Of course, the first was to be re-elected, but the separatists' poorer-than-expected showing suggests that Bouchard will need substantially more time than he had thought to lay the groundwork for another referendum. 

 ``I don't see how Bouchard can call a referendum in the near future,'' said Francois Rocher, a professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa. ``He was elected on good government and now he will have to govern.'' 

 Bouchard said the first part of his term would be ``devoted to achieving good government'' that would create winning conditions for a referendum. He is nearing his goal of eliminating the province's budget deficit, after several years of painful cuts. Achieving that would be a sign of fiscal responsibility that the separatists would use to build confidence in their ability to lead an independent nation.
