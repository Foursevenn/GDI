&LR;  WASHINGTON _ One year after saying China had improved its human rights record, the Clinton administration on Friday issued one of its harshest condemnations of Beijing to date and described some of the most serious human rights violations in a decade. 

 Released on the eve of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's departure for China, at a time when President Clinton has been criticized for being too easy on the government in Beijing, the State Department's annual report on rights said that the country's Communist leaders had broken their promises to adhere to international human rights conventions and instead decided last fall ``to nip in the bud'' attempts to form independent democratic parties. 

 The government also imprisoned several thousand political and religious dissidents, tortured prisoners, suppressed Chinese of minority faiths, especially Christians, and imposed new restrictions on the press, including the Internet, according to the report. 

 Added to a new Pentagon report this week that said China was continuing to be a military threat to Taiwan, the human rights document led Congress on Friday to raise new questions about the effectiveness of the administration's policies of engagement with China. Last year's rather mild description of China's human rights policies provoked criticism that the administration was overreacting to minor improvements in the hope of removing the issue as an obstacle to trade. 

 Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said, ``There is a considerable indignation about the Chinese government's renewed human rights abuses, its proliferation of military technology and its threats to its neighbors.'' 

 On Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution co-sponsored by Wellstone and Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., asking the administration to condemn China's human rights record at an upcoming U.N. meeting in Geneva. 

 ``What's the hesitation of following up on this strong report with a strong condemnation _ unless commercial interests trump all other interests in this administration,'' Wellstone said. 

 The Clinton administration is unlikely to go along with that suggestion. In a speech in San Francisco on Friday, President Clinton defended his administration's policy of engagement with China and suggested China was ``moving away from the rule of fear,' even though it was ``not yet rooted in the rule of law.'' 

 Still, administration officials are worried that China is becoming a tinderbox. 

 ``There is no question that the Chinese leadership is getting very nervous about dissidents and the opposition,'' said a senior official in the Clinton administration. 

 In presenting the report, Harold Hongju Koh, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said Ms. Albright would discuss the report's finding with Chinese leaders when she travels there this weekend but cautioned that even the most ``robust'' dialogue would not necessarily lead to changes in Chinese behavior. 

 ``I think it's a mistake to conclude that the human rights in China is entirely a function of what U.S. policy is,'' Koh said. ``The question here is, how can developments within China, which have led to greater economic freedom, and efforts at legal reform, which could bring about sweeping change, be pressed and pushed through a process of engagement?'' 

 There was no immediate response by the Chinese government to the State Department report.
