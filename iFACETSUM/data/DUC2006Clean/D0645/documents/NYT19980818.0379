WASHINGTON _ Congressional negotiators and the Clinton administration are very close to agreement on legislation that would allow public housing authorities to put more working families into apartments that in recent years have been reserved almost exclusively for the very poor. 

 The change has been sought by officials in many cities who contend that large concentrations of extremely poor people in public housing projects have shattered neighborhoods, sapped their commercial vitality and left them devoid of stable families. 

 For New York and other housing authorities, the changes would free officials to set aside hundreds of more vacant units each year for families making as much as $40,000 a year. The city's housing authority considers the bill a necessary first step toward creating a marketing strategy designed to encourage higher income families to move into its housing projects. 

 The legislation is also expected to give housing authorities greater flexibility in setting rents on the nation's 1.2 million public housing units, authorize mayors in some cities to take over poorly run housing authorities and allow low-income people to use federal housing vouchers to help pay the costs of buying a house. 

 The public housing bill has been pressed mainly by congressional Republicans over the opposition of Democrats and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who have said that the Republican bill would leave poor people without housing. But Cuomo has negotiated changes in the bill that have made it acceptable to many Democrats. 

 Cuomo is also on the verge of winning enactment of two other housing measures that are likely to make it easier for congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration to accept the public housing bill. 

 One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. If approved, the increase would be the first in about five years. Nearly 3 million households now receive housing vouchers. The second would make federally insured mortgages available to at least 17,000 more home buyers a year. 

 Though both of those measures would make relatively small increases in public housing resources, Cuomo contends they are important because the Republican-controlled Congress has perennially talked of cutting housing programs. 

 Lobbyists for housing authorities said the bill also includes a provision sought by several cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, that would make it easier to demolish aging projects. And housing officials across the country are pushing for the legislation because they contend it will help them bring teachers, municipal workers and other low-income working families into projects. &QL;
