TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ General Motors chairman and chief executive John Smith said Wednesday that the world's largest automaker would build a new generation of highly efficient assembly plants in North America. The plants would use far less labor than current assembly plants as outside suppliers, many of them with nonunion workers, would do much work previously done by GM employees. 

 Smith said the new plants would be modeled mainly on GM's efficient new operations in Brazil, and to a lesser extent on other GM factories overseas. Those factories rely on outside suppliers to produce large chunks of vehicles, like fully assembled dashboards, instead of delivering lots of little parts that are bolted together on the assembly line. That is in keeping with GM's move this week to become a company that designs, assembles and markets cars and trucks but makes few of the parts. 

 GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich. Four out of every five outside auto parts factories in the United States are not unionized, so shifting work to them weakens the UAW's grip on the industry and erodes its membership. 

 UAW officials were studying Wednesday's announcement and had no immediate reaction. But GM and the UAW have been quietly discussing the new assembly plants for weeks and the union response in these meetings has been mixed, UAW officials said in recent interviews. 

 The union leaders are pleased that GM is interested in investing at all in the United States instead of overseas, but deeply troubled by the kinds of factories that GM plans to build. The new factories could use half as many workers as the current factories. 

 In a rare speech and news conference in Traverse City, the usually reclusive Smith presented his plans for new assembly plants for the first time, part of a broad vision to change GM, the world's largest company in terms of sales and share of global economic output. 

 GM announced Monday that it would turn its vast auto parts subsidiary into an independent company, with stock in the subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, to be distributed next year to GM investors. GM announced Tuesday that it would combine the corporate staffs of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile and Pontiac into a single marketing organization that might be able to sell cars more effectively, although the names on dealerships and car models would not change. 

 Smith said this week's moves had long been planned and that the strike had only delayed them a little. But Smith has also been under enormous pressure from Wall Street to take decisive action to make GM more competitive.
