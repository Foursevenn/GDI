General Motors Corp. announced Monday that it planned to spin off its gigantic auto parts subsidiary to its shareholders next year, a move that could reignite the labor troubles that led to nearly eight-week-long strikes that ended only last Wednesday. 

 If completed, the move would represent a historic shift away from vertical integration, a corporate strategy in which a company produces most of the parts as well as the final product. Through the 1970s, GM promoted its vertical integration as a source of financial strength and savings. 

 But John F. Smith Jr., the GM chairman and chief executive, said Monday that General Motors wanted instead to be a company that assembles and markets cars, but does not necessarily make a large proportion of the parts inside. The spinoff of the auto parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, ``represents nothing less than a fundamental shift away from vertical integration,'' Smith said. 

 The United Automobile Workers union reacted furiously to GM's announcement Monday afternoon, which followed a regularly scheduled board meeting. ``Should GM decide to proceed with the sale as announced, the UAW's record is clear: we can and will aggressively work to protect the rights and interests of UAW members impacted by the sale,'' Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues, said in a statement. 

 General Motors' national contract with the union expires in September 1999, and the union could try to stop the spinoff of Delphi then with a strike. 

 Through strikes and the threat of strikes, the UAW has sometimes forced GM to postpone or cancel factory sales and closings over the years. Robert Stempel, the former chairman of GM, announced in December 1991 the closing of two dozen factories and the elimination of 74,000 jobs, but some of those factories are still open and the jobs still exist. 

 But a spinoff of Delphi could be an attractive move for General Motors and its shareholders. The UAW currently forces GM to pay the same wages of at least $19 an hour to assembly plant workers and parts factory workers alike, even though nonunion parts makers pay only half as much to their workers. 

 An independent Delphi could try to pay lower wages to its American workers who are members of the UAW. It might be able to sell more parts to other auto makers, which have been reluctant to order from Delphi for fear that it would share parts designs and other competitive information with GM. 

 Ford and Chrysler have to pay the same wages to assembly workers and parts workers, but they disposed of many of their parts factories piecemeal in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when their survival was in doubt. Japanese auto makers pay close to $19 an hour to their assembly plant workers but buy the great bulk of their parts from outside suppliers with much lower wages.
