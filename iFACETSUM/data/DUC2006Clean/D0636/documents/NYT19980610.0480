DETROIT _ A strike by 3,400 workers at a General Motors Corp. metal stamping factory has closed seven assembly plants from Kansas to Canada and parts of three other plants, idling more than 18,000 workers by GM's count and quieting cash registers at nearly every business in Flint, Mich., where the walkout began five days ago. 

 But those problems are minuscule compared with what GM faces Thursday night when 5,000 workers at a second parts-making factory in Flint are expected to decide whether to strike over what they call unmet job security demands. The plant builds an array of components, including spark plugs and speedometers, that are used in almost every GM vehicle. 

 Auto analysts said a strike there would ripple across North America within days, quickly shutting most of the 22 assembly plants not yet affected by the metal-stamping plant strike, causing hundreds of temporary layoffs at independent parts supply companies and depleting dealer inventories of cars and trucks. 

 ``It could be a long June for GM and its suppliers,'' said Mike Robinet, managing director at CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich. Robinet's firm estimates that GM has already lost 14,038 cars and trucks. ``The spark plug plant impacts production at almost every GM plant,'' he said. 

 As leaders of the United Auto Workers all but guaranteed the second strike, economists said a combined work stoppage could trim the nation's production of goods and services by $6 billion, on a yearly basis, if a settlement is not reached before the end of the month. 

 By the end of this week, some economists say, the metal plant strike alone will have reduced the nation's economic output by $500 million. The automotive industry represents 3 percent to 5 percent of the nation's total economy. 

 Workers on the picket line say GM exacerbated longstanding tensions at the plant when it quietly removed several large stamping dies from the factory over the Memorial Day weekend. The machines press steel into parts for its 1999 GMC Sierra, an eagerly awaited full-size pickup truck. 

 GM has not specified where the machines have been redeployed, although they are believed to be at a plant in Mansfield, Ohio. 

 That tactic, along with what the strikers called GM's broken promises on factory modernization, are partly why progress in resolving the strike has stalled, some UAW leaders said Wednesday. Dick Shoemaker, the union's vice president in charge of GM negotiations, said, ``We have the right to expect that when GM enters into an agreement, they will abide by that agreement.''
