MATAMOROS, Mexico _ In one of General Motors' sprawling auto parts plants in a Matamoros industrial park just south of the Rio Grande, thousands of Mexican workers earn $1 to $2 an hour producing instrument panels and steering wheels for GM cars and trucks. 

 Until just a few years ago, U.S. workers earning close to $22 an hour at GM's Delphi East factory in Flint, Mich., made the instrument panels. And those at a plant to the north in Saginaw produced the steering wheels. 

 GM's shift of production from Flint and Saginaw to this border city facing Brownsville, Texas, was part of a sweeping 20-year transfer of its U.S. auto parts industry across the border. 

 Since 1978, GM has built more than 50 parts factories in Mexico, which today employ 72,000 workers, making its parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Services, Mexico's largest private employer. 

 Other companies from the United States have, of course, also moved plants to Mexico. Ford Motor Co. has 11 parts factories in Mexico; Chrysler has none. 

 The transfer of production to Mexico and other countries has become a focus of the United Automobile Workers strike against GM, which began at a stamping plant in Flint and at the Delphi East factory. UAW officials in the United States have accused General Motors of ``putting America last.'' 

 In Mexico, where the strike has idled 23,000 workers at two dozen Delphi plants, Delphi managers have told workers that the union is demanding that GM close its Mexican plants and return its parts production to the United States, said Juan Villafuerte Morales, a union officer representing workers at Delphi's Matamoros factories. The plants have been partially idled by the strike in Flint. 

 ``Most of our workers understand that they're doing work that used to be done in United States factories because managers explain that to them on the plant floor,'' Villafuerte said. ``And let me tell you, the jobs are very welcome here.'' 

 GM says that transferring production south has enabled it to cut costs in labor-intensive assembly production, compete more effectively against Ford, Chrysler and Japanese automakers, and also to keep engineering and other operations in the United States. 

 The financial advantages of producing parts in Mexico are substantial, and some economists say that the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in January 1994, has only increased them. 

 Many plants have no union, and those that do are represented by the Confederation of Mexican Workers, which is controlled by Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and works with the government to avoid strikes. The union has kept the UAW at arm's length. 

 Thousands of Mexican workers at GM and other U.S.-owned factories live in dirt-floor shacks in slums ringing the industrial parks where they work. Yet many say that they are delighted to have their jobs, which often start at Mexico's minimum wage of $3.40 a day but can pay experienced workers several times that. A Delphi spokesman said the company would in the next 18 months help 7,000 employees buy their own homes. 

 ``It's a good job,'' said a 23-year-old woman who earns $1.36 an hour painting buttons on car radios at Deltronicos de Matamoros, a Delphi plant. The woman, who asked that her name not be used during an interview at her one-room wood-frame shed in a gritty, wind-blown Matamoros squatters' settlement, said the choking smell of solvents at her work station gave her headaches. 

 ``It's difficult work,'' she said. ``But I'm glad to have it.''
