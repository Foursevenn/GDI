DETROIT _ Nearly 6,000 workers went on strike on Thursday evening at a General Motors spark plug and speedometer factory in Flint, Mich., joining fellow strikers at a nearby GM plant in an increasingly bitter fight that could close all of the leading automaker's North American assembly plants within days. 

 GM had already closed seven of those assembly plants and temporarily laid off 18,600 workers for lack of parts from the initial strike last Friday at a metal-stamping plant in Flint. Most of GM's other 22 assembly plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico are now expected to quickly run out of the spark plugs, speedometers and other parts made by the giant factory where workers walked out on Thursday night. 

 Angry over what they called unmet demands for job security and improved health and safety conditions, hundreds of workers chanting ``UAW!'' and toting red placards identifying their local union unit mobbed the spark plug factory's gates on Thursday evening. They were joined by workers from the metal-stamping factory, who struck over the same issues. 

 Scattered among the picketers were UAW members from across Michigan and even Ohio and Illinois who had come to show their anger at GM, which has contended with steadily worsening labor relations in trying to make its factories run as efficiently as those of competitors. 

 GM said in a terse statement that it was disappointed by the broadening of the strike to a second parts factory. ``We have committed, talented people and we encourage the union to join management leadership at both facilities to urgently reach settlements that help us effectively work with them to improve GM's competitive position in the marketplace,'' the company said. 

 Union officials at both factories have cited health and safety concerns for their strikes, because the UAW's current contract with GM limits most other walkouts and does not expire for another year. 

 But union officials have acknowledged a broader agenda as well. The spark plug factory workers have been increasingly alarmed in recent years as GM has bought more basic auto parts from outside companies, including some in Mexico, while selling its own factories or cutting back employment. 

 The metal-stamping factory workers have been worried that GM management is assigning other factories work on vehicles not yet in production, possibly signaling the stamping plant's obsolescence.The strikers have also been infuriated by GM's decision to remove, over the Memorial Day weekend, many of the casting dies needed to stamp hoods and other metal parts for GM's new full-size pickup trucks. 

 As in eight other local strikes over the last three years, GM executives have vowed to proceed with their long-standing plans to cut costs. But senior UAW officials have increasingly come to see this confrontation as an emotional struggle, perceiving a threat to the union's long-term survival in GM's willingness to remove equipment from plants where workers are about to go on strike. 

 Two people close to the UAW said that with the broadening of the strike to a second factory, the overall walkout could easily last until the end of June. Union leaders will face pressure to settle so that UAW members can collect full pay during the industry's annual summer vacation in early July. 

 National leaders of the UAW almost never visited the picket lines during eight local strikes against GM over the previous three years. But they have been doing so daily this week. While senior UAW and GM officials refrained from criticizing each other in public during the previous strikes, both sides have been doing so this time. 

 Even people close to the UAW concede that the metal stamping workers in Flint have had one of the most generous special deals in the auto industry. Its provisions allowed some workers to draw a full day's pay for half a day's work. Workers agreed two years ago to give up many of these provisions in exchange for further GM investment in Flint. The union now contends that the investment has not been forthcoming, an accusation denied by GM. 

 The truck parts metal-stamping equipment was transferred by GM to an Ohio factory with a more efficient work force. GM has been planning to build the pickups initially in Oshawa, Ontario. 

 But Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, warned in a telephone interview on Thursday morning that GM should not count on Canadian worker willingness to accept parts produced by equipment taken out of the Flint factory. The Canadian workers were angry that GM managers had made such a presumption. 

 ``We're not noted much for strike breaking,'' Hargrove said. ``If anybody says they're moving those dies and that's your livelihood, logic no longer plays any part of it, it's emotion.''
