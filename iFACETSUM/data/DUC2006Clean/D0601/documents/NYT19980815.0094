WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ The tranquil shore of Wheatfields Lake, a high-country fishing hole set among the ponderosa and sandstone here on the Navajo Reservation, would seem an unlikely place to encounter violence. 

 But a 26-year-old Navajo man who called himself Bam Bam was prepared for the worst, filling his battered pickup truck with gas before setting off with his brother to catch some trout. 

 Too many times, Bam Bam said, gang rivals had beaten him while he was walking home in the dark. In a few other instances, said Bam Bam, speaking on the condition that he be identified only by his nickname, he had done the attacking and had served time in jail for assault. 

 ``It's gotten almost like the inner city here,'' said Bam Bam, unzipping his jacket to show a pistol hidden inside. 

 The spread of violent crime here on the Navajo Reservation, a vast territory of dry plains and red rock mesas in the Four Corners region of the Southwest, reflects problems on dozens of the nation's Indian reservations. While homicide and assault rates have declined across much of the nation in recent years, they have soared in Indian country to rival that of the nation's cities. 

 As the influences of the modern world grow, many reservations _ especially those in the West _ suffer from problems with gangs and drugs. The situation is compounded by the poverty that has afflicted many Indian reservations for generations. 

 ``Our kids have satellite TV and are influenced by things going on in Chicago and New York,'' said Leonard Butler, chief of the Navajo Nation Police Department of 280 for the reservation's 200,000 residents. ``They go to Los Angeles and bring back the way of life of the city, like drive-by shootings, graffiti and tattoos.'' 

 In response to the surge in violent crime on reservations, President Clinton proposed increasing the 1999 law-enforcement budget for the Bureau of Indian Affairs by $25 million, to $100 million. That total was reduced significantly in recent House and Senate votes, and by time the appropriation bill emerges from a conference committee the increase could be below $10 million. 

 Administration officials are also considering reorganizing the law-enforcement division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. One option _ criticized by some tribes and praised by others _ would be to transfer the responsibility for law enforcement to the Justice Department. 

 To be sure, the Navajo Reservation has always had its share of violent crime, but that increased sharply in the mid-1990s. Homicides went from an average of 35 a year at the beginning of the decade to 67 in 1996, and 57 the year after. In the first half of 1998, 18 people have been slain on the reservation, dropping the homicide rate closer to what it was early in the decade. In 1997, Washington had a murder rate of 55 per 100,000 population, Baltimore and Detroit had rates of 46 while Chicago had a murder rate of 27. 

 The picture is similar on some smaller reservations, like the Fort Peck Reservation in eastern Montana. There, the murder rate of 1 for 675 residents in 1995 was twice that of New Orleans, according to a federal report last year on Indian law enforcement. New Orleans, with 1 murder per 1,350 residents in 1995, has one of the highest homicide rates in the country. 

 Combating the crime wave is proving especially difficult because of a lack of police officers on many reservations in the West, experts say. For example, there are 1.4 officers per thousand Navajo residents, compared with 2.9 per thousand for other small communities, the federal report said. The Navajo Reservation is primarily dependent on federal money. 

 The shortage of officers was apparent here over two recent nights, when the officers intervened in drunken domestic fights, hospitalized a man who drank antifreeze and arrested about a half-dozen people on charges of public intoxication. Because only three officers are on duty for evening shifts in a district of 3,055 square miles that includes Window Rock, where the reservation's government is based, some calls for assistance went unanswered for hours. There are seven police districts on the reservation. 

 ``We know we need more police officers,'' said Officer Roanna Buck, ``but that's up to the politicians. The tribal leadership is overlooking the crime because they don't want to admit that it's happening.''
