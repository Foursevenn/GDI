WASHINGTON _ The centerpiece of the Clinton administration's economic policy this year has been a demand that the Republican-controlled Congress forgo tax cuts and set aside the projected federal budget surplus until the nation shores up the Social Security system. 

 It was a move that proved politically successful in blocking a key element of the Republican agenda, and it made economic sense against the backdrop of strong growth and incipient inflationary pressures. But with the global financial crisis rapidly changing the economic outlook for the worse, there are growing questions from both the left and the right about the wisdom of putting fiscal rectitude ahead of the potentially more pressing need to sustain growth. 

 Indeed, with the administration facing the possibility of a recession for the first time since taking office, the White House could face a number of tough choices about whether the market-friendly policies that defined its approach during economic boom times are the best way to approach a more difficult period. 

 ``Bill Clinton's most memorable legacy apart from his White House dalliance will be balancing the budget,'' said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary during Clinton's first term. 

 ``Now that there's a budget surplus, the administration has committed itself to saving the surplus for Social Security rather than succumbing to Republican tax cuts,'' Reich said. ``But this has put fiscal policy into a veritable straitjacket. It's not possible for the White House to talk seriously about stimulating the economy through tax cuts or spending when it has bound itself so tightly to the idea of fiscal discipline.'' 

 Administration officials said it is premature to be talking about a recession and that whatever path the economy takes the United States will have more flexibility and strength now that the deficit has been eliminated. In particular, they said, the Federal Reserve Board now has considerably more leeway to reduce interest rates to counter any downturn than it did the last two times the economy slid into recession, in 1990 and 1981, when the deficit was rising sharply, making inflation worse. 

 ``The basic momentum of economic expansion should continue,'' said Lawrence Summers, the deputy treasury secretary. ``And with a budget in surplus and lower inflation expectations than anytime in more than three decades, the economy is well positioned to respond to any challenges that may arise.'' 

 But just the possibility of a downturn is likely to unleash pressures on the administration to re-examine some of the principles behind its policies. 

 Clinton took office in 1993 planning to give a traditional Keynesian boost to a still-sluggish economy through a big deficit spending package. But he soon abandoned the effort under pressure from his own economic team, which convinced him there would be a considerable payoff in the form of lower interest rates if he could convince the financial markets that he was serious about reducing the budget deficit. 

 Clinton also adopted a hands-off policy towards the Federal Reserve, showing considerable deference to its chairman, Alan Greenspan, and refraining from any public jawboning about official interest rates. Again the intent was to win the confidence of the markets by establishing that the administration would support efforts to squelch inflation. 

 The administration's international economic policies have also been distinguished by a belief in the benefits of bringing down barriers to trade and investment. 

 The approach, embodied most notably by Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, has paid off, in the administration's view. Interest rates have come down. Inflation expectations have been dampened. Seeing a stable environment ahead, businesses have invested heavily in technology and equipment to increase productivity, helping to create new jobs. 

 In addition to helping the country, the strategy has built Clinton a base of political support, and the economy has remained his primary source of political sustenance as he has battled the threat of impeachment. So administration officials, while not ruling out a shift if the economy turns sharply down, say that for now they have no intention of changing course. 

 ``The recipe of fiscal discipline and low long-term interest rates fueling a sustainable pattern of investment-led growth has been enormously successful,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser. ``While one always has to be open-minded in the face of changing economic circumstances, the strong presumption should be to stay with the strategy that has worked over the past five years.'' 

 But the turmoil in world markets has forced the administration to defend the merits of unfettered flows of money around the world and left it scrambling to keep the problems from derailing the domestic economy. And while still hypothetical, the specter of a recession in the United States already has both parties thinking about how to respond.
