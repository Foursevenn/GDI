SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ In the quest for great grapes, some growers along the northern California coast, including the wine industry leaders Michael Topolos and Michael Benziger, are embracing age-old peasant farming methods and performing rituals such as burying cow horns and spreading crystals in their vineyards. 

 ``I did this on a leap of faith. I don't even pretend to understand all this stuff, but I'm committed because I've seen the results in my vineyards,'' said Topolos, co-owner of Topolos at Russian River Vineyards near Forestville. He said yields have increased and grape quality has improved. 

 Topolos and Benziger, both practical businessmen prominent in the wine industry, are among the practitioners of biodynamic agriculture, a system of raising crops that uses methods as old as farming itself along with some New Age spirituality. 

 Simply stated, biodynamics is an organic farming system that doesn't employ pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers. Instead, it relies on manure, crop rotations, biological pest control and cosmic forces to put life back into soils and the ecology surrounding the vineyard. It works with nature and involves astronomy and homeopathy. 

 ``If nothing else, biodynamic farming is helping to clean up the chemical disaster caused by pesticides and fertilizers that came with the industrialization of agriculture following World War II,'' Topolos said. ``We can't continue to poison our way through.'' 

 Some scientists dismiss biodynamic farming as junk science and question its impact on grape quality. 

 ``This kind of thing is used more as a marketing tool to sell wine,'' said Dr. Roland Meyer, a soil science specialist with the University of California, Davis. 

 ``Chances are biodynamic farming would have little or no effect on the flavor of the grape or the quality of wine.'' Biodynamics is so mystical and far-fetched, he said, that it's not even considered for further research at UC Davis. 

 It's estimated that biodynamic farming methods are used on 1,000 of the 100,000 acres of vineyards on the northern California coast. The percentage is small but with names like Topolos, Benziger and Fetzer involved, this kind of farming is considered more than a fringe movement. 

 ``The North Coast is the hot spot for biodynamic farming in California,'' said Chuck Beedy, executive director of the San Francisco-based Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association. The approach also is gaining momentum in France, he said, where dozens of wine estates have adopted biodynamic farming methods. 

 Thirty vineyards, orchards and vegetable farms are certified biodynamic in Northern California, Beedy said. Nationwide, he said, 50 growers have earned biodynamic certification. 

 Biodynamic farming was developed in the 1920s by Austrian-born philosopher and spiritual leader Rudolph Steiner, who came up with a system of composting and special preparations that remains the foundation of the biodynamic farming movement. 

 Benziger, president of Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen, said he was drawn to biodynamics because of the promise that wine grapes will attain superior flavors _ flavors that reflect the vineyard site, a term the French call terroir. Pesticides and herbicides kill natural organisms that give grapes an originality specific to the site, he said, an individuality that cannot be copied anywhere else in the world. 

 Before adopting biodynamics two years ago, Benziger had weaned his vineyards from toxic chemicals. 

 ``The goal is to produce a wine that is one of a kind, a wine that has sense of place and a uniqueness that cannot be duplicated,'' Benziger said. 

 Other winemakers believe great wines can be made without using biodynamic principles. 

 ``Biodynamics may be good for the soil and environment, but is it going to make a better wine?'' asked Mike Gulyash, winegrower at Glen Ellen's B.R. Cohn Winery, which has won accolades and awards for its ultra-premium wines. ``Biodynamics is not a bare-bones requirement to make a great wine.''
