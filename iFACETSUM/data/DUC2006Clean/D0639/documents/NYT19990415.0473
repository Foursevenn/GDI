The United States believes that the Yugoslav army has stocks of lethal and nonlethal chemical weapons and that some of the less deadly forms have probably been given to the Serbian paramilitary forces that have terrorized Albanians in Kosovo, according to Pentagon and other Clinton administration officials. 

 Pentagon officials said Thursday that the administration had no evidence that the Yugoslav army or the Serbian forces had used, or were planning to use lethal chemical agents against either the ethnic Albanians they have been driving out of Kosovo or the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been battling Yugoslav forces in the Serbian province. 

 But President Clinton warned Yugoslavia Thursday that America's response to any use of chemical agents or other unconventional weapons would be ``swift and overwhelming.'' The United States has ``intelligence about the capabilities of the Serbs in a number of areas militarily,'' Clinton said, addressing a meeting of newspaper editors in San Francisco. ``I think they are quite well aware of the dangers of overly escalating this,'' he added. 

 Pentagon officials said Thursday that Yugoslavia had a ``chemical warfare capability'' that included both lethal chemicals and those that were capable of incapacitating but not killing people. Belgrade, they said, has ``weaponized CS,'' a form of tear gas, and has ``probably made this weapon available to Serbian paramilitary forces.'' 

 The officials added that the Yugoslav army might also have made weapons out of BZ, an incapacitating agent that causes hallucinations and delirium, and were ``suspected of having unknown quantities'' of mustard and deadly sarin gas, which have not yet been put into weapons. 

 Even sarin gas that has not been mounted on weapons can kill or make people desperately ill, the officials said. The Japanese religious cult Aum Shinrikyo killed 12 people and injured thousands more in a 1995 terrorist attack in which cult members punctured plastic bags containing liquid sarin in the Tokyo subway. 

 Pentagon officials said they had no evidence that Yugoslavia was making or testing biological weapons. 

 The administration has been extremely reluctant to discuss Yugoslavia's ability to develop, produce and stockpile chemical weapons and other unconventional arms, or, as they are sometimes called, weapons of mass destruction. 

 But an official said Thursday that the military was ``concerned'' both about the advanced chemical weapons program that Yugoslavia maintained before its breakup in 1991 and its subsequent efforts to reconstitute its program and stockpile both lethal and nonlethal chemical agents and weapons. 

 So far, one official said, Yugoslav centers suspected of being involved in the development and production of chemical agents have been off NATO's target list because of concerns that a direct hit on a chemical center might result in an explosion that could either kill civilians or make them very sick. 

 But NATO forces have struck such centers and other targets where the weapons that could dispense chemical agents are made or stored. NATO has also hit buildings where the equipment to produce such weapons might have been manufactured or stored, the official said. 

 One official stressed, however, that any concern about avoiding these locations would disappear if NATO and the Pentagon determined that the Yugoslav army used chemical weapons either on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or on the Kosovo Liberation Army.
