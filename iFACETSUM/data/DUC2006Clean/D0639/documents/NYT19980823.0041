WASHINGTON _ Facing questions about the U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, the Clinton administration on Sunday sought to justify the strike by offering more details linking the factory to the production of chemical weapons. 

 Two administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in the weeks leading up to last Thursday's strike, the United States had obtained a sample of a critical chemical used in the making of VX, a deadly nerve agent. 

 The administration has so far declined to lay out its evidence publicly except to say there was ``physical evidence'' of the precursor chemical at the factory, in an industrial area of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. The officials declined to name the chemical, which the administration has classified, but they said it had no other known use that would explain its presence in the plant, called the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. 

 The United States struck the plant in Sudan and a paramilitary training camp in Afghanistan on Thursday with a simultaneous barrage of roughly 75 cruise missiles. President Clinton and his aides have said the attack was to punish Osama bin Laden, a Saudi exile that the United States has accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks, including the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7. 

 They have also said they had credible evidence that bin Laden's organization planned to carry out additional attacks against Americans. Appearing on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, said the bombings in Africa were just the start of a campaign orchestrated by bin Laden's network. 

 ``On the 7th of August, we saw the attack against the two embassies, and we had very reliable and convincing information that might be only the first of two of three or even possibly four attacks,'' Shelton said. 

 But he said the evidence pointing to new attacks did not include the location of potential targets. 

 Although administration officials and lawmakers from both political parties who have seen the evidence have insisted that it is irrefutable, questions have continued to arise. 

 In Sudan, the government has insisted that the pharmaceutical factory was a benign commercial venture and called on the United Nations to investigate the U.S. strike. On Sunday, government officials took the chief U.N. representative in Sudan, Phillip Borel, on a tour of the debris from the factory, which was heavily damaged in the strike. 

 The factory was obliterated by the strike, which one U.S. official said was designed to make the building fall in on itself, limiting the chance of toxins escaping into the air. 

 People who toured the area afterward were able to see pharmaceutical products in the debris. Administration officials do not dispute that the factory might have had commercial purposes. The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said Sunday that it would not be readily apparent from the debris that production of a VX precursor had been under way. 

 ``I'm not sure that anyone visibly can identify what chemicals might be in and around the vicinity,'' he said Sunday on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``There is no question in our mind that that facility, that factory, was used to produce a chemical that is used in the manufacture of VX nerve gas and has no other commercial distribution as far as we understand. 

 ``We have physical evidence of that fact,'' he added, ``and very, very little doubt of it.''
