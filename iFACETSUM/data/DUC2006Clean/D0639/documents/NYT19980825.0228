KHARTOUM, Sudan _ At the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when Sudan was one of Iraq's few remaining friends in the world, the government here struck a bargain with Baghdad, foreign diplomats and Sudanese said Tuesday. 

 In return for Iraqi financial help and assistance by military and civilian experts, Sudan agreed to allow its installations to be used by Iraqi technicians for steps in the production of chemical weapons, they said. 

 The deal was beneficial to both countries. Struggling Sudan got economic help, and Iraq was able to move ahead with chemical weapons far away from the gaze of U.N. weapons inspectors. 

 ``Sudan is a wonderful place to do secretive things,'' a former Sudanese government official said. 

 A diplomat here said the Clinton administration had known about the Iraqi chemical weapons activities here for some time. The United States attacked a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum last week and says it was because the factory was making a rare chemical used for the nerve agent VX. 

 The Sudanese government has insisted that the factory was used only for the manufacture of medicines and has called for an international investigation to prove its contention. 

 The diplomats and the former government official said it was not absolutely clear at which of several plants the Iraqis were working on chemical weapons or their precursors. It was not clear either, the diplomat said, whether completed chemical weapons or only precursors were being produced. 

 They said, however, that a military complex on the southern outskirts of the city, not the plant that was attacked, was the most likely place for the production to have been taking place. 

 Immediately after the gulf war, 40 Iraqi government employees were sent to the heavily guarded military complex, one diplomat said. 

 ``The Iraqis are there to guard chemical weapons or substances that Iraq doesn't want in Iraq,'' the diplomat said. 

 Hundreds of other Iraqi experts have worked in various fields in Sudan since the gulf war, including the manufacture of munitions, the diplomat and the former government official said. 

 The destruction of the pharmaceutical factory in the industrial area of Khartoum was a surprise because the enterprise had been touted since its opening in early 1997 as a breakthrough in the local production of inexpensive medicines, the diplomat said. 

 Administration officials said Monday that the pharmaceutical factory, Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, had been targeted after soil samples from outside the plant, secretly obtained months ago, were found to have a rare chemical needed for the manufacture of VX. 

 The chemical, ethyl methylphosphonothinonate, known as Empta, has no industrial uses, the administration official said. The only viable explanation for the presence of the ``precursor chemical'' is the production of VX, the official said. 

 Tuesday, administration officials said the pharmaceutical plant was not the only installation in Sudan suspected of producing chemicals for VX, but rather the one where the United States had the most persuasive evidence. 

 ``There were other facilities where there was really hard evidence,'' an official said, ``but there was not a smoking gun; there was not a soil sample.'' 

 It seemed possible that the pharmaceutical factory was not actually making the ``precursor chemical'' that the administration described, the diplomats here said. They believed that the factory had been chosen as a target because it could be more precisely hit than the military plant and did not run the risk of spreading deadly vapors. 

 The administration has said in the last two days that it was confident of its justification for hitting the pharmaceutical plant and saw no reason for an investigation into whether Empta was produced there. 

 Traces of Empta would survive destruction of a site by fire, said a chemical weapons expert, Amy Smythson of the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington. The center specializes in arms control research. 

 Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said Tuesday in Washington: ``We see evidence that we think is quite clear on contacts between Sudan and Iraq. In fact, el Shifa officials, early in the company's history, we believe, were in touch with Iraqi individuals associated with Iraq's VX program.''
