The discovery that autistic children appear to have subtle abnormalities in body movements that can be diagnosed as early as 3 months old is leading researchers to hope for new treatments. 

 The findings, by Philip Teitelbaum, a psychologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville, are preliminary. But they have generated intense interest because for the first time, a method is being proposed for diagnosing the condition in babies whose brains are still developing rapidly. 

 Most autism is not diagnosed in children until they are at least 3 years old. But if there were a reliable way to diagnose autism earlier, Teitelbaum and other researchers said, doctors might be able to devise therapies to alleviate or eliminate the condition, when the brain is its most malleable. 

 Autism is a disorder of the brain and behavior that affects about 5 of every 10,000 children. While autistic children appear healthy, they may stare into space for hours, throw tantrums, show no interest in people and pursue repetitive activities, like head banging, with no apparent purpose. 

 Teitelbaum made the discovery by examining videotapes of babies who were later found to be autistic. These infants showed a specific cluster of movement abnormalities when rolling over, sitting up, crawling and walking, Teitelbaum said in a telephone interview. 

 But, he cautioned, the results are still preliminary. Researchers need to look at many more babies, he said, to see exactly which movement abnormalities can predict autism and which suggest developmental disorders like schizophrenia or attention deficit disorder. 

 ``I think he's on to something,'' said Dr. Dan Geschwind, a neurogeneticist at the University of California at Los Angeles and scientific adviser to Cure Autism Now, an organization based in Los Angeles run by parents of autistic children. ``He's got a very intriguing piece of preliminary data which, if it turns out to be true, will be very important.'' 

 Temple Grandin, a highly functioning autistic woman who is an assistant professor of animal science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and an authority on animal behavior, said: ``He's on to something really good, and I fully support it. I like the fact that he is objectively measuring something that is biological.'' 

 It may be, she cautioned, that Teitelbaum has discovered general problems in the nervous system that are not unique to autism. But even that, she said, is a benefit for doctors, parents and teachers, who now have nothing to go on before children are 2 or 3 years old. 

 Anne Donnellan, a professor of rehabilitation psychology and special education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said: ``Teitelbaum's work is important because it reflects a reality about autism that has been missed. We tend to think it's a problem with the mind. But now that we are really beginning to see how the brain works, we know that the mind is embodied. Body is part of mind and there's no way to separate them.''
