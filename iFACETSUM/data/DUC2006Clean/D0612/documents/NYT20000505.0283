WEST WINDSOR, N.J. _ One family came from India, others from Greece, Italy and Israel. An Australian family is thinking about coming. By comparison, Rob and Anne Mandel had it pretty easy, giving up his medical practice and a life they loved in Indiana to get their son, Sam, the help he needed in New Jersey. 

 Sam is autistic, and his parents' move here made the Mandels part of a phenomenon: families that, desperate for the most sophisticated special education services for their disabled children, have moved from other states and even other nations in search of care. 

 But, increasingly, the needs of parents with autistic children are clashing with the bottom lines of school districts that have to pay for enormously expensive services _ often more than $40,000 per child per year _ for students who may never set foot in district classrooms, but will be sent to private institutions at a school district's expense. 

 Most districts are sympathetic to the needs of families, increasingly armed with sophisticated knowledge about programs and treatments, who uproot themselves to get their children the best care. But many districts, particularly in states like New Jersey with programs that are magnets for families around the country and the world, say schools are bearing too much of the cost with too little control over which children get what care. 

 ``It's driving the suburban school districts crazy,'' said James H. Lytle, the superintendent of Trenton's public schools. ``If you have eight kids who need to go to a special school, you have to go to your taxpayers for $400,000. That's essentially like sending them all to Andover.'' 

 Dr. Lytle added, ``I hate the whole thing.'' 

 A 1975 federal law, guarantees a ``free and appropriate public education'' for all disabled students. But the education available in most places cannot compare with what is offered in states like New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which have the most sophisticated private programs for treating autism. So families, many of whom share information on the Internet, are increasingly relocating to areas with the best programs. 

 Total school enrollment in New Jersey grew by 11.8 percent from 1991 to 1997, the most recent year for which comparable figures are available. The number of disabled students increased by 14 percent. The number of autistic children registered in New Jersey increased sevenfold, from 234 to 1,634. 

 Part of the increase may be due to better diagnostic methods or the inclusion of children with behaviors that resemble autism. But migration obviously plays a major role. 

 ``If you're a parent of a child that has been diagnosed with something like autism, you are not going to wait,'' said Gary S. Mayerson, a New York lawyer who specializes in representing families battling school districts over care for disabled children. ``You are going to look at your beautiful house and realize that it is a noose around your neck. So people are moving all over the country to get to states that are most responsive to their child's needs.'' 

 The treatment most in demand for autism is a method known as applied behavioral analysis, a form of highly structured and very expensive one-on-one coaching by trained teachers. While other treatments try to help youngsters cope with their disabilities, applied behavioral analysis, administered at an early age, offers children the possibility of eventually being able to attend regular classes, its advocates say. 

 So parents flock to the Princeton Child Development Institute, where Sam Mandel and 34 other students are enrolled, or the Eden Institute, in West Windsor, N.J., or to the Martin C. Barell School, in Levittown, N.Y. And they go to the Connecticut Child Development Center in Milford, where a couple from India showed up with their child earlier this month, hoping in vain to gain enrollment even though the school was full, said Suzanne Letso, the school's director. 

 ``I'm a doctor _ I sent people to have sophisticated tests all the time in Indiana,'' Dr. Mandel, an anesthesiologist, said. For that reason, he said, ``I thought there was no reason to be closer to New York City to get these sophisticated services for Sam. But you know what? There's nothing back there like what we have here.'' 

 For $46,024.20 per year, the Princeton institute provides 10 months of intensive training to help autistic children discover a sense of the rewards of learning that they are born without. Although they may be capable of brilliant feats of intellect _ think of Dustin Hoffman's character in ``Rain Man'' _ autistic children totally lack both curiosity about the world and the instinct to learn by imitating other children and adults. 

 Patricia Krantz, director of the Princeton institute, said that half the children who came to her school early enough were sent to regular classrooms within five years. If people object to paying something like $200,000 to achieve such a goal, she said, they should think of the alternative: a lifetime of institutionalization, ``not to mention the human cost.''
