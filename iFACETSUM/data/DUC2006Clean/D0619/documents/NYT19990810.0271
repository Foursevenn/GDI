WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republican presidential candidates are creating an atmosphere that is subtly but fundamentally more inviting to gay and lesbian voters than party leaders have been in recent memory. 

 Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain and Elizabeth Dole _ who combined have the lion's share of support among Republicans in early polls _ have signaled an openness to gay supporters, including a willingness to appoint them to positions like ambassadorships. 

 The new receptivity toward homosexuality follows a similar soft-pedaling by leading Republicans on abortion. While they still oppose abortion and are by no means converts on other gay rights issues like same-sex marriage, the most prominent candidates are offering a lower-key, more inclusive approach designed to appeal beyond the conservative base of the party to independent and Democratic voters in a general election. It also reflects the continued growing political influence of gay donors and gay voters across party lines. 

 The new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996, when Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay party members, and from 1992, when the dominant voice on the issue from Republicans was that of Patrick Buchanan, whose declaration of a ``culture war'' was aimed squarely at homosexuals. 

 Buchanan and other conservative candidates have not changed their views, and even Bush, McCain and Mrs. Dole have not embraced a broader gay agenda that also includes adoptions by gays and a less punitive approach toward gays in the military. But gay political leaders say the difference in attitude is striking nonetheless. 

 ``The tone has totally changed,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans. ``What I hear is gay Republicans enthusiastic about the tone being set by the leading candidates. It looks like Republicans for the first time are saying, `This is a community I'm not going to alienate and maybe I want to reach out to it.' That's kind of a shocking revelation.''
