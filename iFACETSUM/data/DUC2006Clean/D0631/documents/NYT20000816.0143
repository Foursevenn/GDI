LONDON _ British aviation authorities on Wednesday formally ruled the Concorde supersonic airliner unfit to fly unless its manufacturers took steps to prevent the problems that led to last month's fatal Air France Concorde crash near Paris. The French said on Wednesday that they were contemplating a similar step. 

 The British authorities said the accident's ``primary cause'' was a tire that burst and expelled debris that ruptured a fuel tank. The withdrawal of the Concorde's airworthiness certificate by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority was the first such action against a commercial airliner in more than 20 years. 

 Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash of Concorde Flight AF 4590, which plunged to the ground about 90 seconds after take-off, killing 113 people in the first fatal accident involving the supersonic airplane. British Airways, the only other Concorde operator, grounded its entire fleet of seven Concordes on Tuesday after learning that the airworthiness certificate would be revoked Wednesday. 

 Without an airworthiness certificate, aircraft are not permitted to fly. British Airways said Wednesday that it had suspended Concorde flights through September, but gave no clear indication whether it believed the aircraft _ which crosses the Atlantic in about three and one-half hours at up to twice the speed of sound _ would ever return to commercial service. 

 The Concorde has been plying scheduled trans-Atlantic and charter routes for almost 25 years and had come to be seen as an icon of prestigious travel for executives and celebrities ready to pay up to $10,000 for a round-trip ticket. 

 After the July 25 crash, French investigators said they believed that a metal strip on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris had caused a tire to burst. The blow-out caused chunks of rubber to rupture fuel tanks located in the wings close to Concorde's four jet engines. Concorde's spindly, stork-like landing gear is positioned directly below the wings and engines. 

 But, while Air France suspended its Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash, British Airways ordered only a one-day suspension before putting its own Concordes back into service. British aviation experts said the British Concordes had been modified to protect the wings from tire blow-outs in the mid-1990s, while Air France Concordes had not been modified. 

 However, Malcolm Field, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, an official regulatory body, said, ``It is clear to all of us on the CAA that a tire burst alone should never cause the loss of a public transport aircraft.'' 

 He said the authority had asked Concorde's manufacturers, BAe Systems, Airbus UK and Aerospatiale of France, to devise a plan to insure that accidents could not be caused by a tire blow-out. Under aviation regulations, airplanes whose fuel tanks are vulnerable to catastrophic damage from burst-tire debris may not be certified as airworthy. 

 Field rejected the idea that the demand for modifications effectively meant the Concorde would never fly again. ``We would wish Concorde to fly again,'' he said.
