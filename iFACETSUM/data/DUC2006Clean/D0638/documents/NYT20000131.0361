When the durability and longevity of spacecraft have counted most, on long voyages to the outer planets of the sun, fortune has smiled on American space scientists. 

 There was plucky Pioneer 10, the first to reach Jupiter and then Saturn in the early 1970s. Its five-watt radio signal could still be heard, a decade later, as Pioneer became the first machine of human design to leave the sun's planetary system. 

 And there was Voyager 2. Cruising beyond Jupiter and Saturn, the spacecraft survived the creakiness of old age to swing by the other two outer giants, Uranus and Neptune, in the 1980s. Looking back, Voyager 2 was still able to take a family portrait of the planets, specks of light dancing around a stellar maypole. 

 In the same tradition of hardihood, the Galileo spacecraft has defied engineering's actuarial tables to complete more than four years of orbiting Jupiter and taking in the sights of its four major moons, each one a spectacle to the eye and a surprise to the scientific mind. 

 Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa. 

 In an especially close encounter with Europa last month, the spacecraft picked up strong signals of peculiar changes in Jupiter's magnetic field at Europa. 

 It is the most compelling evidence so far, scientists said last week, of an electrically conducting material in Europa's subsurface, like an ocean of salty water. Since liquid water is an essential ingredient of life, these intriguing clues have encouraged speculation that the first extraterrestrial life, however simple, may be found in the seas of Europa. 

 A report in the current issue of the journal Nature describes how Jupiter's intense radiation could provide all the energy necessary for chemical reactions to create and maintain living organisms in a subsurface ocean, if one exists at Europa. 

 Dr. Christopher Chyba of Stanford University proposed that in the absence of sunlight for photosynthesis, the radiation bombardment ``should produce organic and oxidant molecules sufficient to fuel a substantial Europan biosphere.'' 

 Galileo's enduring successes have been a happy surprise in view of its early prospects, which were none too bright. 

 Launched in 1989, Galileo took six years getting to Jupiter by a circuitous route dictated by the power limitations at its sendoff. The spacecraft's full capability has been hobbled by the failure of the main antenna to unfurl and the erratic behavior of a tape recorder. In the last year, repeated zappings from Jupiter's intense radiation belts have damaged some spacecraft instruments. 

 ``In general, the spacecraft is reasonably healthy,'' said James K. Erickson, the project manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``We've survived much longer than anyone thought we would.'' 

 As its engineers like to say, Galileo has kept going ``well past its warranty.'' Designed to operate two years around Jupiter, the spacecraft was cleared in December 1997 for a mission extension of two more years. It has now been given another lease on life, beginning Tuesday. 

 The length of the lease is problematic. Fuel for maneuvering the craft is running low. Its gyroscopes for navigating are on their last legs. And officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are debating the cost-effectiveness of operating Galileo for the full 14 additional months of operations requested by scientists and engineers of the project. 

 Their eagerness to keep Galileo going has been fed by its most recent observations, especially those revealing the four largest Jovian moons to be spectacularly diverse worlds. They were discovered in 1610 by the spacecraft's namesake, Galileo Galilei, who recognized in their orbits a kind of solar system in miniature but had no inkling of what they looked like. 

 Over the last two years, the target of most of the Galileo spacecraft's close encounters has been Europa. Scientists wanted a better look at this ice-covered moon, about the size of Earth's moon. They were intrigued by the many cracks running for a thousand miles or more across an otherwise fairly smooth crater-free surface. The cracked landscape reminded them of broken glass repaired by an icy glue oozing up from below. 

 This and other aspects of the surface geology suggested that a layer of liquid water could lie beneath the outer shell of ice. Scientists reasoned that the strong tidal forces of Jupiter caused regular expansions and contractions of Europa. The flexing is the most likely source of the heat in the moon's interior needed to melt a layer of water between its outer icy surface and its rocky interior, at a depth of perhaps 60 miles. 

 Such conjecture has stirred wide interest among scientists because liquid water is one of the essential ingredients of life. 

 On Jan. 3, Galileo flew within 218 miles of Europa, about the altitude that space shuttles often maintain above Earth and close enough for detailed observations by the spacecraft's magnetometer. 

 Europa lies within Jupiter's magnetic field, which changes direction in the vicinity of Europa every five and a half hours. This fluctuation can drive electrical currents in a conductor, like an ocean of salt water. 

 Galileo, scientists reported, detected the kind of magnetic disturbances that would be predicted if the Jovian magnetic-field variations had produced an electric current through a conductor on Europa. Rock and solid ice are poor electrical conductors, but a salt-water ocean would be perfect. 

 ``I think these findings tell us that there is indeed a layer of liquid water beneath Europa's surface,'' Dr. Margaret G. Kivelson, a geophysicist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said two weeks ago. ``I'm cautious by nature, but this new evidence certainly makes the argument for the presence of an ocean far more persuasive.''
