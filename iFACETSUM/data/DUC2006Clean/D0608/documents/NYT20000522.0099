``Black boxes'' for cars, a technology borrowed from the airline industry, now are poised to help auto-accident investigators pin the blame on drivers responsible for causing crashes. 

 Since 1990, many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have been equipped with a device similar to an airliner's black box, or flight data recorder, which automatically records the vehicle's speed, throttle setting, braking effort and engine rpm for each of the five seconds leading to an air-bag deployment. 

 Until now, however, it was difficult to extract that information from the car's air bag control module. 

 But a California company in March began selling a device that connects a car's onboard computer to a laptop computer to quickly extract such key information from a crashed vehicle. 

 The $2,500 device _ called a Crash Data Retrieval System _ is being marketed to police departments, insurance companies and auto-rental agencies to help them reconstruct crashes to determine fault. 

 ``The system lets investigators collect objective, accurate data on crashes to enhance reconstruction (of accidents),'' said Jim Zaleski, president of Santa Barbara-based Vetronix Corp., which markets the device. 

 ``This opens the door to a new generation of understanding and modeling automobile accidents,'' he said. 

 Some of the vehicles that have the capability to provide such data also can tell investigators whether the car's occupants were wearing seatbelts and whether the passenger-side air bag had been deactivated. 

 Most of the data that the system gives to crash investigators isn't new _ such information has been used for decades to reconstruct accidents, said Phil Haseltine, president of the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety, an auto-industry funded group. 

 But investigators had to gather the information using other sources, such as tire skid marks, in the past. Now they can get it from the vehicle's onboard computer. 

 ``This technology isn't measuring anything new, but it is measuring it more accurately than in the past,'' he said. 

 ``On the engineering side, it will help the design engineer find out whether safety systems work as well in real crashes as they do in laboratory crash tests. I predict we will see crash data recorders used by more automakers as they install more advanced air-bag systems.'' 

 But Haseltine and others, including officials at General Motors, say there are privacy issues that have kept the technology from advancing as rapidly as it could have. 

 The data that a police investigator or insurance adjuster extracts from the car's air-bag control module could be translated into hard evidence for use in prosecution of a driver who is at fault in an accident, or for use by plaintiffs in lawsuits over such accidents, critics warn. 

 Vetronix says it is in negotiations with the California Highway Patrol to provide the devices to its officers, and the company plans to market the system aggressively to police agencies and insurance companies nationwide. 

 ``The capability to use this information in a intrusive manner is there, and we should all be vigilant to make sure nobody tries to do that,'' Haseltine said. ``Manufacturers aren't putting these systems in vehicles with the intention that just anyone would be able to access the information. 

 ``Giving the technology to police investigators is a gray area,'' he said. ``If a judge orders it in a court case, it can eventually wind up in court. But it's likely that we will only see that in very serious crashes with expensive litigation. I can't imagine using it for every little fender-bender.'' 

 General Motors has a ``strict policy that the data belongs to whoever owns or leases the vehicle, and it won't be accessed without their consent,'' said Terry Rhadigan, the automaker's safety spokesman. 

 But Vetronix promotes the system as something investigators can use almost immediately, at a crash site, to download the information, and there are concerns that such a situation sometimes might preclude getting a vehicle owner's permission. 

 The impetus to record this information to aid crash investigators came from the National Transportation Safety Board, which recommended in 1997 that automakers develop onboard collision-sensing and -recording devices. 

 The NTSB has long required that such equipment be installed on most modes of public transportation, including airliners, buses and trains. But this is the first time the technology has been extended to private passenger cars. 

 So-called recordable air-bag modules have been installed in many General Motors vehicles since 1990, but it has just been recently that the data from an air-bag deployment or near-deployment could be easily downloaded for use by investigators. 

 ``There is value to this data,'' GM's Rhadigan said. ``The more we know about how our vehicles perform in the real world, the more we can improve them. It's another way to aid in accident reconstruction, along with eyewitness reports.''
