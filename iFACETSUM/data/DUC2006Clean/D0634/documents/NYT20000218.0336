SEATTLE _ Lending political momentum to an idea that would have been unthinkable in a different era of Pacific Northwest history, Gov. John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon announced Friday that he favored breaching four large federal dams on Washington state's Snake River in an effort to restore endangered salmon populations. 

 Kitzhaber, a Democrat, became the first major political figure to endorse the controversial dam-removal proposal, which is passionately favored by many environmental groups, American Indians and commercial fishermen, but opposed with equal fervor by farmers and many others in the interior Northwest who now rely on the tamed Snake River for barge shipping and electricity. 

 The debate will almost surely wind up in Congress, sometime after the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the dams, issues its own opinion on the proposal next year. 

 Just how much influence Kitzhaber's stand will have remains to be seen, but it is nonetheless an intriguing reflection of changing times in man's relationship with the rivers of the Northwest, where some hydroelectric dams generate enormous amounts of power but have also proven lethal on a major scale to the region's fabled salmon runs. 

 ``In the end, the answer will be a political one _ informed by good science _ but based on a set of values and on the degree of economic and ecological risks the region is willing to accept,'' Kitzhaber said in a speech to the American Fisheries Society in Eugene, Ore. ``It is time that we shoulder our responsibilities and develop a blueprint for action.'' 

 Construction of Northwest dams was an undeniably epic engineering achievement, celebrated in Woody Guthrie's songs more than a half-century ago. But for the last several decades, the Corps of Engineers has been laboring under federal requirements, to help dams and the salmon coexist on the Snake but has met little success. 

 Despite spending more than $3 billion on projects such as fish ladders, hatcheries and even a truck-and-barging system that a Corps brochure describes as ``custom-made to make the trip as safe and comfortable as possible'' for the fish, the salmon populations have declined. 

 The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act. In the early 1800s, when the explorer William Clark discovered a river ``crouded with salmon,'' about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the trip back to their spawning grounds, biologists estimate.

 Ed Bowles, Idaho's manager of anadromous fish, those that hatch in fresh water and migrate to the sea, said today that 3,276 Snake River adult spring and summer chinook returned last year, down from 8,426 in 1998. Fall chinook returns were estimated to be about 400, slightly up from 306 in 1998.

 Under the dam-breaching proposal now being considered by the Corps, earth around the dams would be removed, rendering the dams themselves inoperative and restoring 140 miles of the Snake River in eastern Washington to a wild, free-flowing condition. Many scientists and biologists have endorsed dam breaching as the step that would have the greatest odds of saving the salmon from extinction. 

 The dams _ Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite _ would be the biggest federal dams ever slated for removal. But there is no guarantee that the plan would work, and it would take out of service dams that provide about 4 percent of the Pacific Northwest's electricity. (Unlike other dams in the region, the Snake dams are not used for flood control.) 

 The dams were also constructed to turn Lewiston, Idaho, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and nearly 500 miles from the Pacific Ocean, into the West's most inland seaport. But virtually all barge traffic to and from Lewiston would stop if the dams were breached. 

 Lawmakers in eastern Washington have lined up against any breaching. Republican lawmakers throughout the region have been generally united against the idea. U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who is running for re-election this year, said taking down the dams would be ``an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare'' for the region. 

 Many Democrats have been non-commital on the idea, but Kitzhaber, who said Friday that the region should feel shame for losing what were ``once the greatest salmon runs on the face of the earth,'' has now become the first major political figure from the region to endorse breaching.
