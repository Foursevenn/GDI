BIRMINGHAM, England _ Police stopped Carl Josephs on suspicion of having a stolen car. They stopped him on suspicion of having a criminal record. They stopped him on suspicion of carrying drugs, of not wearing a seat belt, of driving where he did not belong. They stopped him, he said, 34 times in two years, until finally he started taking the bus to work. 

 Because he never was found to have done anything wrong _ never ended up with so much as a speeding ticket _ Josephs, a quality-control supervisor in a meat factory, could only conclude that he was singled out because he was black and drove a car with a big picture of Bob Marley, the late Jamaican reggae star, on the back. ``Every time I went out of the house, the first thing I thought is, `Am I going to be harassed?' '' he said. 

 Finally, he couldn't take it any more. In the first case of its kind in Britain, he sued the West Midlands Police, complaining that he had been racially harassed. And though he won on only one of his complaints _ that he had been wrongfully stopped on one occasion _ his case added to what has become an increasingly noisy debate in Britain about the way police treat people from minority groups. 

 For years, black and Asian Britons have complained about what they see as overt and tacit police racism, and except at times of particular upheaval, like the riots in Brixton in 1981, no one in authority in Britain has paid much attention. 

 But in the last few months, the issue has been at the forefront of the country's consciousness. More and more people like Josephs are making public complaints. 

 Home Secretary Jack Straw recently told a parliamentary committee that he planned to require Britain's police departments to hire more minority officers. And the government is poised to release a stinging report about race and the police that is likely to order nothing less than a sea change in British police culture. 

 The impetus for all this is the six-year-old case of Stephen Lawrence, a case that Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, described in an interview as ``Rodney King without the video.'' 

 Lawrence, an 18-year-old black student who was set upon and stabbed to death in South London in 1993 by a group of white youths who directed a racial epithet at him. What happened to him _ and how police apparently botched the inquiry _ has proved a galvanizing force among minority groups, as well as forcing the rest of the public to pay attention. 

 ``The Stephen Lawrence case has got such exposure that in other places, like Birmingham, cases of racial terror and injustice are finally being recognized,'' said Maxie Hayles, chairman of the Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit. ``It's a shame that it should take the death of a schoolboy to bring this out in the open, but unfortunately that's what did it.'' 

 Straw is due to release a much-anticipated independent report this month on police handling of the case. The report is expected to present a damning portrait of police incompetence and racial prejudice, and to conclude that the Metropolitan Police, Britain's largest police force, is guilty of pervasive institutional racism. 

 Richard Norton-Taylor, whose play about Lawrence's killing, ``The Color of Justice,'' has been playing to rave reviews in London, said that the attention paid to the Lawrence case and others was a sign that British attitudes toward the overarching authority of the police and other institutions were finally being called into question. 

 ``There's been an antipathy building up toward the cops for all sorts of different reasons, but it hasn't been part of the culture to have movements, to protest in an organized way,'' he said. ``But what we're seeing now is that there's a slow building up of demands for more openness, whether on racism or consumerism or medical matters. There is much less deference.''
