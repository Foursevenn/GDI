NEW YORK _ Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com. 

 The online venture, which is scheduled to open for business this summer, is the most ambitious element in a series of countermeasures to promote independent bookstores by the American Booksellers Association, the dominant trade group for a beleaguered fraternity that has seen its share of the popular consumer book market shrink to about 17 percent today from 32 percent in 1991. 

 Those pressures have continued to intensify with competition from superstore chains and online bookstores, prompting some store owners to abandon the business with bitter complaints that they are under siege. The electronic bookstore and a planned national marketing campaign are the first collective efforts of an ordinarily disparate group of independents. The goals is to compete against some of the forces that have reduced ABA membership to about 3,300 from 5,200 in 1992. 

 ``We're not trying to knock off the Goliaths _ I don't want to look naive,'' said Hut Landon, a bookstore owner in Mill Valley, Calif., and the executive director of the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, which developed the pilot concept last year. ``All we're trying to do is retain our market share. We recognize that we've got to do this in this day and age. We can't just be quaint little booksellers in our community asking how the kids are.'' 

 The association already has organized a series of 12 customer focus groups along with the development of the electronic bookstore. In its initial stages, the store will feature all the standard functions of popular online sites, including a search engine, a stock of 1.5 million titles, credit card fulfillment, gift wrapping, distribution services and a best-seller list. But it will also allow individual stores to tailor Web pages to reflect their individuality with store reviews and features. 

 ``What we're really trying to do is find the different ways that we can do what our competitors are doing,'' said Michael F. Hoynes, the association's newly hired marketing officer. He said initial interest in the program was enthusiastic because booksellers have been asking for a collective approach. 

 The booksellers' association, based in Tarrytown, N.Y., will begin its first national marketing campaign in May for the Book Sense brand, which in some ways is inspired by the example of the independent hardware stores that promote themselves under the True Value label. 

 The association plans to spend about $2 million to develop the electronic bookstore and about $2 million more on the marketing campaign _ money that comes in part from its half-share of $25 million that the association won from Penguin Group USA in a dispute over favorable discounts that were given to large retail bookstore chains. 

 In Northern California, where there is a strong and active group of independent booksellers, the regional association has also spent about $100,000 to promote a common identity under the name Book Sense. The brand and a slogan, ``Independent Bookstores for Independent Minds,'' are appearing in newspaper advertisements and on decals, posters, and plastic shopping bags in the Bay Area, where more than 200 bookstores have signed up to participate in the pilot program. 

 But the collective approach envisioned by the national association is broader in scope, conceivably allowing customers to order books online with the freedom to pick up or return a book at any participating Book Sense store. The association is already in discussions with a national wholesaler, Baker & Taylor, to provide distribution services, a critical element for an online service that caters to customers with swift delivery. It is also considering expanding the electronic title base to include out-of-print books.

 At this point, the pricing system still is being determined, although individual bookstore owners will have great flexibility to offer discounts on their templates, said Len Vlahos, the association's spokesman. 

 Within the next few months, the association will start signing up members to participate in the electronic project, which would cost bookstore owners monthly development fees expected to range from $175 to $450.
