In an escalating battle of the books, Amazon.com Inc., the online retailer, cut the prices on best-selling books by 50 percent Monday, a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com, all of whom will almost certainly lose money on the bargain rates. 

 Amazon's price-cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for its No. 2 rival, Barnes & Noble Inc., which has imminent plans for a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks.

 But a company spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon.com said the timing of its discounts on books from The New York Times best-seller lists was a matter of coincidence. 

 ``There are three things that drive this business,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon. ``It's selection, price and convenience. And we are constantly working on all three of these things. We've added convenience with distribution centers that will get merchandise faster to customers. And this is an opportunity to do something with price.'' 

 With a flurry of announcements on Monday, the three electronic booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on The Times best-seller lists. That amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any given week. 

 Generally, publishers offer books to retailers for less than half of the list price, which means that the electronic rivals will be losing money with these discounts on best sellers. 

 But that did not seem to deter the major booksellers, who offered similar reasons for plunging ahead. 

 ``We intend to remain competitive in the marketplace,'' said Leonard Riggio, the chairman and chief executive of Barnes & Noble, who added that Amazon has ``changed their prices in the middle of a public offering for Barnesandnoble.com and that speaks for itself.''

 With a certain element of distaste, Borders.com, a unit of Borders Group Inc., also announced a price-cut. ``I have to tell you that this is not the battlefield that we think we're going to win on in the long run,'' said Rich Fahle, a spokesman for Borders.com. ``But we're not going to let this distinguish us from the competition.'' 

 None of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50 percent discounts. And, in fact, Amazon was issuing refunds on the difference in price to customers who bought best-selling books shortly before its announcement of the discounts.
