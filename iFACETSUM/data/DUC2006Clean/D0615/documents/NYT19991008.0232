SANTA FE, N.M. _ Bucking recent changes in Kansas and other states that allow public schools to teach alternative views of human development, the New Mexico Board of Education voted overwhelmingly on Friday to limit the statewide science curriculum to the teaching of evolution. 

 The vote effectively made New Mexico the first state in recent years to take a firm stand against the teaching of creationism, which generally recognizes the Bible as the ultimate authority on how the world was formed. 

 Creationism holds that a divine being created humans and other species a mere 10,000 years ago, while evolutionists say scientific evidence shows that life began almost 4 billion years ago with simple organisms, from which humans and all other forms of life evolved. 

 Until now, teachers had been required to give equal weight to alternative theories _ which in practical terms meant creationism _ in their science classroom discussions. 

 ``This gives teachers the political cover they need to teach evolution,'' said Marshall Berman, the board member who led a three-year campaign to change the policy. 

 The board voted 14-1 in favor of the change, which will affect the 100,000 children who attend New Mexico's 725 public schools. The lone dissenter, Van W. Witt, objected by arguing that students should be allowed to consider all sides of the debate and then ``make up their minds with their parents.'' 

 In the brief debate among board members that preceded the vote, Berman refuted that position, insisting that creationism _ or ``intelligent design,'' as some evolution opponents call it _ is not a comparable theory for teaching in public schools. 

 ``If the assumption is there are two sides, I question the assumption,'' Berman told Witt. ``The sense is of creationism as a scientific theory, that it exists as a reliable principle. But it is not based on science.'' 

 While the often emotional debate between proponents of creationism and evolution is not new, it was rekindled this summer when the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete almost any mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum. 

 In a similar action, the Education Department of Kentucky deleted the word ``evolution'' from the state science curriculum, replacing it with the phrase ``change over time,'' which some state teachers interpreted as an attack on widely-accepted scientific principles. 

 Other states, including Alabama and Nebraska, have made other changes that allow for discussion of theories that challenge evolution. 

 Creationists hailed each of those changes as major victories during a time when the teaching of evolution has enjoyed pre-eminence in most public school districts as a result of a 1987 Supreme Court decision that said states could not compel the teaching of creationism in public schools. 

 In their battles to chip away at the dominance of evolution as the unchallenged explanation of life, creationists have run headstrong into teachers and scientists who have effectively lobbied their state and local school boards, as they have here in New Mexico, to keep evolution at the forefront of classroom discourse. 

 Flora M. Sanchez, the president of the New Mexico Board, said that since the Kansas decision she had received ``a lot of negative input'' from scientists and teachers around the state who were uncomfortable with performance standards that required teachers to entertain alternative theories to evolution. Many of the board members felt uneasy with comparisons with Kansas, she said, adding, ``So we decided we had to clarify our standards.''
