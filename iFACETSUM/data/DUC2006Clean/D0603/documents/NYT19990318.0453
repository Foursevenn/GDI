NEW YORK _ After repeated efforts to persuade the federal government to strictly limit building on marshes around New York City's upstate reservoirs, the Giuliani administration reversed itself this week, saying the wetlands needed no special protections. 

 The city's new position echoes the views of Republican officials from rural communities around the reservoirs and pits city officials against private environmental groups and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which say that special restrictions are needed because wetlands help to purify the city's water. 

 The change was outlined in a March 15 letter from Environmental Protection Commissioner Joel Miele to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is updating federal rules for wetlands. 

 Some environmental groups and Democratic city officials assailed the move and accused Giuliani of putting his possible race for the Senate, and his need for Republican support outside the city, ahead of his responsibility to protect the water supply. 

 Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, denied there was any political motive behind the change. One of Miele's deputies made the original recommendations, and Miele never approved them, Lhota said. 

 Lhota defended the city's new stance, saying the city's water supply was already sufficiently protected from pollution. ``Anyone who makes the argument that these new rules would protect the watershed any further, that's just false and cheap politics,'' he said. 

 The city reversed its stance on the new restrictions after the original recommendations angered Republican state legislators and county officials, who called Giuliani and Miele to complain that tighter rules would stifle development.
