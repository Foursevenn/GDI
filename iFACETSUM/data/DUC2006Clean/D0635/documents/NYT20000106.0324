HOUSTON _ George W. Bush had not quite finished his second week as governor of Texas in 1995 when the first death penalty cases of his administration landed on his desk. They would make for quite an initiation: Two executions were scheduled for Jan. 31, a rare event known on death row as a doubleheader. 

 Because he would be out of Texas that day, Bush reviewed the inmates' clemency appeals with his legal staff, approved the executions and instructed the lieutenant governor to proceed in his absence. The two convicted murderers, Clifton Russell and Willie Williams, became the first inmates put to death under Bush, though hardly the last. 

 In his five years as governor, Bush has presided over the executions of 111 men and one woman, far more than any other governor in any other state since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Texas leads the nation in putting inmates to death, and in 1997 the state executed four inmates in one week, eight in one month and 37 for the year _ all modern records. 

 For governors in most states, the grim job of approving an execution is a rare exercise. For Bush, capital punishment has helped define him as a politician. By any measure, his commitment to capital punishment is unquestioned. But as he campaigns for president, his death penalty record offers insight into his distinct views of mercy and justice. 

 In his two most controversial cases, Bush allowed the execution of a repentant born-again Christian, despite appeals from religious leaders, including the pope, but stayed the execution of a confessed serial killer who appeared to have been wrongly convicted of the slaying for which he had been sentenced to die _ evidence, Bush's admirers say, of his willingness to make difficult choices based on principle. 

 In Texas, which led the nation in executions before Bush took office, public support for capital punishment is wide and deep. By law, the governor cannot unilaterally commute a death sentence. But Bush has appointed every member of the parole board that can make that decision. He signed a law speeding the appeals process _ and, therefore, executions _ and resisted efforts to change Texas' much criticized clemency process. 

 The governor's critics describe the Texas system for capital crimes as the most unfair and merciless of the 38 states with a death penalty, saying it deprives the accused of adequate legal aid and appeals. Other states, including Florida, where Bush's brother, Jeb Bush, is governor, see Texas as a model of efficiency. 

 George W. Bush's own actions and statements have made clear a firm philosophy on death row justice: with almost no exceptions, the punishment must be meted out. 

 ``All I can tell you,'' Bush said in 1998, ``is that for the four years I've been governor, I am confident we have not executed an innocent person, and I'm confident that the system has worked to make sure there is full access to the courts.'' 

 This month, as Bush campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination in Iowa and New Hampshire, seven Texas inmates are scheduled to be put to death, including one who committed his crime as a 17-year-old. Another, whose lawyers tried but failed to have declared incompetent for execution, will be put to death on the night of the full moon, at his request. 

 Whether the steady beat of executions will cause disquiet for Bush on the campaign trail is far from certain. The potential for distasteful headlines became apparent in December when Texas officials chose to remove a hospitalized inmate from intensive care, where he had been taken after a suicide attempt, and fly him directly to the death chamber, rather than stay his execution. 

 ``The death penalty is certainly popular in Texas, but as it's practiced, it seems extreme compared to the rest of the country,'' said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, a group often critical of the way capital punishment is administered. 

 But conventional political wisdom holds that a politician cannot be too supportive of the death penalty, when polls say that nearly three out of four Americans favor it. In the 1992 Democratic primaries, Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, interrupted campaigning to approve the execution of a brain-damaged murderer. This year, every presidential candidate supports capital punishment. 

 Eric Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in Washington, said politicians know that the public's sympathy for convicts is very limited. The public, he said, also pays little attention to the problems faced by many poor defendants, most notably in getting adequate representation. 

 ``I don't think voters care,'' said Sterling, whose group studies criminal justice issues. ``The public, I think, feels that accused defendants get the benefit of all kinds of `rights.''' He predicted that the executions would not cost Bush votes or undermine his campaign theme of ``compassionate conservatism.'' 

 ``Compassionate means that the role of government is to help those who are innocent and deserving,'' he said in analyzing Bush's strategy.
