BALTIMORE _ In the year he has suffered from osteoarthritis, Harold Katcoff has followed his doctors' advice, to no avail: aspirin, steroids, the latest anti-inflammatory drugs. The pills, he says, offer little relief from the stabbing pain in the back of his knees. So Katcoff, an 80-year-old retired pharmacist, is trying Chinese medicine instead. Or at least, he thinks he is. 

 Every Tuesday and Thursday since late November, Katcoff has come here, to Kernan Hospital, to see an acupuncturist who pokes him with 20 needles, nine in each leg and two in the belly, and then hooks the probes to a mild electrical current. The patient is convinced that the therapy works. 

 ``It's fantastic,'' Katcoff says. But in the same breath, he admits that he cannot be certain if the effect is real or imagined. 

 That is because Katcoff may be receiving sham acupuncture _ needle sticks in places where, according to the theories of traditional Chinese medicine, they should not do any good. He is a volunteer in a $2.5 million federally financed study, run by a rheumatology professor and a family-practice doctor at the University of Maryland. 

 The study represents a new wave in academic medicine: the application of rigorous, Western scientific methods _ including the gold standard of medical research, the placebo, or fake therapy, as a control _ to test alternative therapies, from ginkgo biloba to shark cartilage to a mystical Chinese healing art known as qi gong. 

 Just five years ago, many academics would not have gone near such studies, for fear they would become laughingstocks. And while alternative therapies remain hugely controversial in the stodgy world of science _ ``quackupuncture'' is how one vocal critic, Dr. Victor Herbert of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, summed up the University of Maryland's work _ large, multimillion-dollar clinical trials are getting under way this year at some of the nation's most prestigious university hospitals. 

 ``The scientific games have begun,'' declared Dr. David Eisenberg, director of the Center for Alternative Medicine Research and Education at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston. Or, as Dr. Barrie Cassileth, chief of integrative medicine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said: ``The research is just coming into its maturity. It's bar mitzvah time.'' 

 The boom is being driven by the National Institutes of Health, which, under pressure from Congress, has sharply increased its budget for studies of alternative medicine. Eight years ago, much to the chagrin of institute leaders, Congress required the institutes to establish an Office of Alternative Medicine, a tiny operation with a budget to match, just $2 million. 

 ``It was,'' said Dr. Daniel Moerman, a medical anthropologist at the University of Michigan, ``like setting up an office of deviltry within the Catholic Church.'' 

 But after a rocky beginning, the office is gaining acceptance at the institutes and is setting the tone for scientists around the country. Last year, Congress upgraded the office, making it the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which means it now has grant-making authority. Its yearly budget has grown to $68 million. 

 In October, a new director came on board, Dr. Stephen E. Straus, a virologist and longtime NIH insider whom Dr. Harold Varmus, the former director of the institutes and once one of the program's biggest detractors, describes as ``a really distinguished scientist.'' 

 At the same time, hospitals and medical schools are bowing to economic reality: alternative medicine is big business. According to the Nutrition Business Journal, an industry trade publication, Americans spent $27.2 billion in 1998 on providers of alternative health care, including those in chiropractic, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy and massage therapy. Sales of herbs are also growing, to $4.4 billion last year, from nearly $2.5 billion in 1995, the journal said. 

 A survey of more than 2,000 adults, conducted by Eisenberg and published in November 1998 in The Journal of the American Medical Association, estimated that 46 percent of the American population had visited a practitioner of alternative health care in 1997, up from 36 percent in 1990. Patients like Katcoff, who had never before tried alternative therapies, are increasingly doing so. 

 ``Consumers are saying, I want some type of care and I will pay for it out of pocket if I need to,'' said Dr. Brian Berman, the principal investigator in the Maryland acupuncture study. ``I think that has been heard by the medical establishment.''
